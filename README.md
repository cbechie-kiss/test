# What is K.I.S.S.
At one point of time you probably heard this phase from a co-worker,
parent, or teacher "Keep It Simple Stupid." No they did not call you
stupid. K.I.S.S. simply means that the task you are working on is
oddly complex (i.e., stupid) and the best way to approach a "stupid"
problem is with simplicity in mind. By doing so you can solve the
complexity without adding any additional oddities. Easier said then
done. 

However, many people snarl at the thought of being called stupid
and don't give K.I.S.S. a chance. My ambitions for writing this is to
educate beginner programmers on the proper meaning of K.I.S.S. and share
my personal favorite tools to solve a "stupid" problem. Most of if not
all of these tools can be applied to any filed of study not just programming.
